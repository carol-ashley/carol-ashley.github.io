            <p>While we have only been dating for around 6 months, we have been
               through a lot together! We’ve had some pretty incredible times and
               some pretty crazy ones too. So, in tribute, here are a couple of
               moments that stood out in the past year.</p>

          <p>It was around the end of last year when you asked me if I’d like to
             emcee for a talent show you were putting on. Little did I know this
             would end up sparking something between us. It was during the talent
             show that we first started talking and growing closer! It was during
             the talent show that you first flirted with me and I started dropping
             my super subtle hints. It wasn’t long afterwards that we got together
             for our study session which was the first date of many to come.</p>
